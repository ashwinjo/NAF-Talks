# About Me

## Professional Overview

I am a seasoned **Network Automation and Solutions Engineer** with over a decade of experience building intelligent, scalable automation systems across enterprise and cloud environments. My career spans:

- Software Development
- DevOps
- Network Testing
- Cloud-Native Architectures

I combine deep engineering expertise with the ability to translate complex concepts into clear, actionable insights for customers and teams. My background includes impactful roles at industry leaders such as **Amazon** and **Microsoft**, where I gained a strong foundation in large-scale distributed systems and customer-centric solution delivery.

## Current Role

Currently, at **Keysight Technologies**, I work as a Solutions Engineer specializing in:

- **Network Automation**
- **Network Test**
- **Visibility Solutions**

In this role, I help customers modernize their testing and operational workflows using platforms like **IxNetwork**, **CyPerf**, and **Open Traffic Generator**. My work focuses on bridging traditional network engineering with modern automation practices—leveraging Python, APIs, DevOps tooling, and now GenAI-driven agents—to:

- Simplify complex test scenarios
- Accelerate validation cycles
- Improve operational reliability

I frequently collaborate with engineering teams, product groups, and customers to design PoCs, build automation frameworks, and deliver architectural guidance grounded in real-world performance and scalability needs.

## Applied GenAI & Innovation

Over the past year, I've expanded my focus into **Applied GenAI**, developing:

- **Agentic Systems**
- **RAG-based Applications**
- **Automation Frameworks**

These solutions address practical networking challenges including:

- BGP labs and Containerlab topologies
- OTG traffic generation
- MCP-driven agents
- AI-assisted troubleshooting

Having worked across the entire network automation lifecycle—design, modeling, orchestration, configuration, testing, observability, and now AI-driven operations—I bring a holistic perspective on how AI and automation can elevate the reliability, performance, and agility of modern networked systems.
